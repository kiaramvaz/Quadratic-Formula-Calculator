            <h1 id="aboutHeader"> About the Quadratic Formula!!</h1>
            <p> The Indian mathematician Brahmagupta (597–668 AD) explicitly
                described the quadratic formula in his treatise
                Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta published in 628 AD,[7] but written in
                words instead of symbols.[8] His solution of the quadratic 
                equation ax2 + bx = c was as follows: "To the absolute number 
                multiplied by four times the [coefficient of the] square, add 
                the square of the [coefficient of the] middle term; the square
                root of the same, less the [coefficient of the] middle term, 
                being divided by twice the [coefficient of the] square is the
                value.</p>
